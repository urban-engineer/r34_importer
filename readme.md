Basic importer for posts from the rule 34 booru that isn't using [shimmie](https://github.com/shish/shimmie2).

Uses Postgres, so spin up a DB for that before continuing.

Spin it up, go to `localhost:8000` (or wherever you point it), go to the Posts Index, then Ingest Posts from IDs. 

I'll probably commit a docker file, and a compose file, when I find the free time.  But this is pretty whatever so have fun.

Feel free to point out how my DB design is bad, I barely work with them and just kinda got it into a working state then moved on.
